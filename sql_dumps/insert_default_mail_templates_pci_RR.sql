1	#NewMembreshipRecommender	default	{{appName}}: Welcome as a recommender!	Mail to user to acknowledge their status of recommender	<p>Dear {{destPerson}},</p>\r\n<p>Congratulations on passing the PCI RR recommender test! I just added the role of recommender to your profile so you now appear at our <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/recommenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>&nbsp;and can be invited to handle submissions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>If you are new to RRs and/or to PCI RR and would like help from an experienced recommender on the first submission you handle (if you have already handled a submission(s), you can still ask for this), you can contact any of the following recommenders to see if they would be willing to be a co-recommender with you. The co-recommender would take a back seat, be available to answer questions, and offer feedback as needed throughout the process. Chris did this for me on the first submission I handled and I felt reassured that he wouldn’t let me do anything wrong (I was nervous I was going to mess up). I found it really useful to ask a few questions and then emailed him to ask him to look over the submission at the website when I was ready to submit a decision.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Here is the list of experienced recommenders you can ask to be co-recommenders (after you accept an invitation to be a recommender for a particular submission):</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/public/user_public_page?userId=5">Zoltan Dienes</a>&nbsp;(<a href="mailto:zoltan.dienes@googlemail.com">zoltan.dienes@googlemail.com</a>)</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/public/user_public_page?userId=232">Rob McIntosh</a>&nbsp;(<a href="mailto:r.d.mcintosh@ed.ac.uk">r.d.mcintosh@ed.ac.uk</a>)</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/public/user_public_page?userId=163">moin syed</a>&nbsp;(<a href="mailto:moin@umn.edu">moin@umn.edu</a>)</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;- <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/public/user_public_page?userId=198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlotte Pennington</a> (<a href="mailto:c.pennington@aston.ac.uk">c.pennington@aston.ac.uk</a>)</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/public/user_public_page?userId=346">Matti Karhulahti</a>&nbsp;(<a href="mailto:vmmkar@utu.fi">vmmkar@utu.fi</a>) - qualitative research</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/public/user_public_page?userId=233">Sam Schwarzkopf</a>&nbsp;(<a href="mailto:s.schwarzkopf@auckland.ac.nz">s.schwarzkopf@auckland.ac.nz</a>)</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Of course, the PCI RR Managing Board is always available to support you with all of your submissions, so just write to us at this email address and/or join our Mattermost group for recommenders if you have any questions at any time. <em>If you are interested in joining the Mattermost group, respond to this email and we will send you an email invitation.</em></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Below are a few details about the recommender role that apply to all PCIs...</p>\r\n<p>The role of a recommender is very similar to that of a journal editor (finding reviewers, collecting reviews, making editorial decisions based on reviews), with the possibility of recommending the reports you have chosen to handle after one or after several rounds of reviews. The evaluation process is designed to guide decisions as to whether to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the report.</p>\r\n<p>A report recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like any ‘traditional’ article published in a peer-reviewed journal. If you decide to recommend a report, you will need to write a “recommendation”, which will have its own DOI and be published by {{appName}} under the license CC-BY. The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News &amp; Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context and explains why the preprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of the report can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the report being recommended). All of the editorial correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) will also be published by {{appName}}.</p>\r\n<p>As a recommender for {{appName}},</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You will be expected to comply with the code of conduct of {{appName}}, which can be found there (<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/ethics">https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/ethics</a>).</li>\r\n<li>You are eligible for selection as a member of the Managing Board for a period of two years.</li>\r\n<li>You will be notified about new articles recommended by {{appName}}, according to your requested notification frequency and fields of interest.</li>\r\n<li>You will also receive requests to initiate preprint evaluations in your fields of interest with a view to recommending them.</li>\r\n<li>You can propose the nomination of new recommenders to the Managing Board.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There is also a guide for PCI RR recommenders (<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_recommenders">https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_recommenders</a>). Details about the recommendation process can be found here (<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/full_policies">https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/full_policies</a>) and in this short <a href="https://youtu.be/u5greO-q8-M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you so much for your time and support! It's great to have you on board!</p>\r\n<p>All our best,</p>\r\n<p>The Managing Board of {{appName}}</p>

Briefly, your reports must first be deposited on a server, such as bioRxiv, and must not already be under review for publication in a traditional journal.</p>\r\n<p>When submitting your reports, you are allowed to suggest recommenders. A recommender is very similar to a journal editor (responsible for finding reviewers, collecting reviews, and making editorial decisions based on reviews), and may eventually recommend your preprint after one or several rounds of reviews. A report recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like any ‘traditional’ article published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have submitted your report, one of the recommenders you suggest, or any other recommender from the community may express an interest in initiating the evaluation process for your report, which will involve sending your report out for peer review.</p>\r\n<p>If you wish to submit a report, please click on the "Submit a report" button on the home page of the {{appName}} website.</p>\r\n<p>As a user, you will also receive alerts every {{days}} concerning recommendations in the following fields published on the {{appName}} web site: {{thematics}}.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, if you are interested in becoming a recommender for {{appName}} - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BDrPoHGkn0">see video</a> - please see details at our website (https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/become_a_recommenders).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again for your interest and for joining {{appName}}.</p>\r\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\r\n<p>The Managing Board of {{appName}}</p>

If you opted for a private embargo, note that the embargo will be released and the registered protocol made public when any one of the following conditions are met: submission of the Stage 2 manuscript; withdrawal of the submission and consequent triggering of a Withdrawn Registration; or natural expiry of the embargo at the end of the period you selected in the Stage 1 submission checklist.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Progressing to Stage 2.</strong> You may now move to Stage 2 and complete the study as approved. We would be grateful if you could now update the PCI RR Managing board (<a href="mailto:contact@rr.peercommunityin.org">contact@rr.peercommunityin.org</a>) as to the anticipated completion date of your study. This deadline can be readily altered in consultation with the Managing Board (e.g. in case of delays requiring additional time to complete the research). However, in the event that you should fail to submit the Stage 2 manuscript within 6 months of the mutually agreed deadline and also become non-responsive during this period to enquiries, then the manuscript will be considered by PCI RR to be de facto withdrawn, triggering publication of a Withdrawn Registration.</div>\r\n<div>Following completion of your study, we invite you to resubmit one or more Stage 2 Registered Reports, depending on whether this IPA applies to a regular RR (involving one Stage 2 output) or a programmatic RR (involving multiple Stage 2 outputs). If you are receiving IPA for a programmatic RR then please familiarise yourself with the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_52492857233251613309610581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting requirements for programmatic RRs at Stage 2</a>.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Stage 2 review criteria (see <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_6720026472751613309075757" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>)</strong>. Please note that a Stage 2 manuscript can be rejected by PCI RR if the recommender and Managing Board consider any of the following conditions to be met:</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The results were unable to test the authors' proposed hypotheses (or answer the proposed research question) by failing to meet any approved outcome-neutral criteria, such as the absence of floor and ceiling effects, success of positive controls or other quality checks</li>\r\n<li>The authors altered the Introduction, rationale, or hypotheses, as approved in the Stage 1 submission</li>\r\n<li>The authors failed to adhere to the registered study procedures or preregistered analyses (and see below concerning necessary deviations from protocol)</li>\r\n<li>Any <em>post hoc</em> (unregistered) analyses are either unjustified, insufficiently caveated, or overly dominant in shaping the authors' conclusions</li>\r\n<li>The authors' conclusions were not justified given the data obtained</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Deviations from protocol.</strong> Please note that any deviation from the registered study procedures that is not approved in advance by the recommender and Managing Board could lead to rejection at Stage 2. In cases where the preregistered protocol must be altered after IPA due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g. change of equipment or unanticipated technical error), it is imperative that you consult the recommender immediately and prior to the completion of data collection, regardless of how minor the deviation may seem. Minor changes to the protocol that do not increase risk of bias are likely to be swiftly approved. In such cases, IPA would be preserved and the deviation reported in the Stage 2 submission.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Notification of PCI RR-interested journals.</strong> If you consented to notifying PCI RR-interested journals about your IPA then the complete list of <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/pci_rr_interested_journals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCI RR-interested journals</a> will now be given access to the author names, stated contact details, Stage 1 reviews and recommendation text (provided you also consented to publish the reviews and recommendation at the point of IPA), as well as the URL to the Stage 1 manuscript that has been registered by PCI RR (even if preregistered under a private embargo).</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Recommendation text</strong>. The recommender handling your submission has written a Stage 1 recommendation to accompany this decision letter. The recommendation is a short summary describing the context of the study and explaining why the article was accepted and is expected to make a valuable contribution. The recommendation will also state the URL to the registered Stage 1 manuscript on the OSF, the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_95790490510491613309490336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">level of bias control</a> that was reached in your submission, and will list all eligible <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/pci_rr_friendly_journals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCI RR-friendly journals</a> that endorse this IPA decision and will later accept your approved Stage 2 manuscript(s) without further peer review. As noted in the author guidelines, the PCI RR Managing Board determines which PCI RR-friendly journals are eligible based on the disciplinary fit, word limit requirements, minimum pre-planned strength of evidence (e.g. level of statistical power), level of bias control achieved, and any other listed journal requirements (such as the acceptance of signed reviews only). <strong>If you opted for the Stage 1 recommendation to be made public at the point of IPA then you will find it now published on the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCI RR website under the heading "Latest Recommendations"</a>. </strong>However, if you opted to keep the Stage 1 recommendation and reviews private until Stage 2 acceptance, then they will not appear on the PCI RR website until the completion of Stage 2.

The evaluation forms the basis of the decision to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the report. A report recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like &nbsp;‘traditional’ articles published in peer reviewed journals.</p>\r\n<p>If, after one or several rounds of review, you decide to recommend this report, you will need to write a “recommendation” that will have its own DOI and be published by {{appName}} under a CC-BY 4.0 license. The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News &amp; Views piece. It has its own title, is 300-1500 words, describes the context, and explains why the report is particularly interesting. The limitations of the report can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the report being recommended).

You can obtain information about this request and accept or decline this invitation by following this link&nbsp;<a href="{{linkTarget}}">{{linkTarget}}</a> or by logging on to the {{appName}} website and going to 'For recommenders —&gt; Request(s) to handle a preprint' in the top menu.</p>\r\n<p>The role of a recommender is very similar to that of a journal editor (finding reviewers, collecting reviews, taking editorial decisions based on reviews), and may lead to the recommendation of the preprint after several rounds of reviews. The evaluation forms the basis of the decision to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the preprint. A preprint recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like the ‘classic’ articles published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>\r\n<p>If after one or several rounds of review, you decide to recommend this preprint, you will need to write a “recommendation” that will have its own DOI and be published by {{appName}} under the license CC-BY. The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News &amp; Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context and explains why the preprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of the preprint can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the preprint being recommended). All the editorial correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) will also be published by {{appName}}.</p>\r\n<p>If you agree to handle this preprint, you will be responsible for managing the evaluation process until you reach a final decision (i.e. to recommend or reject this preprint). You will be able to invite, through the {{appName}} website, reviewers included in the {{appName}} database or from your own network.</p>\r\n<p>Details about the recommendation process can be found here&nbsp;<a href="{{helpUrl}}">{{helpUrl}}</a>. You can also watch this short video:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/u5greO-q8-M">How to start and manage a preprint recommendation</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>\r\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\r\n<p>The Managing Board of {{appName}}</p>

143	#ReminderReviewerReviewInvitationRegisteredUserStage2	default	Invitation to review a Stage 2 submission that you previously reviewed at Stage 1 - reminder	Mail to user already registered to remind about a Stage 2 review invitation	<p>Dear {{destPerson}},</p>\r\n<p>This is a kind reminder concerning the following message, which you should already have received:</p>\r\n<p>Following in-principle acceptance (IPA) of a Stage 1 submission that you reviewed, the authors have submitted a follow-up Stage 2 manuscript entitled "<strong>{{art_title}}</strong>". The Stage 2 manuscript contains the content from Stage 1 plus the results and conclusions, and I am writing to ask if you would kindly consider reviewing it for us. A clean version of the Stage 2 manuscript can be viewed and downloaded at the following address: <a href="{{art_doi}}">{{art_doi}}</a></p>\r\n<p>In evaluating Stage 2 manuscripts, we ask reviewers to assess:</p>\r\n<p>2A. Whether the data are able to test the authors’ proposed hypotheses (or answer the proposed research question) by passing the approved outcome-neutral criteria, such as absence of floor and ceiling effects or success of positive controls or other quality checks.</p>\r\n<p>2B. Whether the introduction, rationale and stated hypotheses (where applicable) are the same as the approved Stage 1 submission.</p>\r\n<p>2C. Whether the authors adhered precisely to the registered study procedures.</p>\r\n<p>2D. Where applicable, whether any unregistered exploratory analyses are justified, methodologically sound, and informative.</p>\r\n<p>2E. Whether the authors’ conclusions are justified given the evidence.</p>\r\n<p>The PCI RR website includes an <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_reviewers#h_6720026472751613309075757" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded description of these review criteria</a>, additional <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_reviewers#h_7586915642301613635089357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tips for reviewing a RR</a>, and <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_reviewers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete reviewer guidelines</a>. To ensure swift handling of submissions, the requested review time is <strong>{{reviewDuration}}</strong>, but if you are unable to review the manuscript within this time then please let me know by reply email and we can extend the timeframe. Where possible, it is important that the same reviewers evaluate submissions at Stage 1 and Stage 2.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that the statistical significance, novelty, or perceived importance of findings will not factor into editorial decisions.</p>\r\n<p>In the event of a favourable outcome, all editorial correspondence (Stage 2 reviews, recommender’s decisions, authors’ replies) and a recommendation text will be published by PCI RR under a CC-BY 4.0 license. If, after one or several rounds of review, the Stage 2 manuscript is rejected, the editorial correspondence (and specifically your Stage 2 review) will NOT be published. You will be notified by e-mail at each stage in the procedure.</p>\r\n<p>Note that to avoid any conflict of interests, where you know the identity of the submitting authors you should not accept to evaluate this submission if the authors are close colleagues (people belonging to the same laboratory/unit/department in the last four years, people with whom you have published in the last four years, with whom you have received joint funding in the last four years, or with whom you are currently writing a manuscript, or submitting a grant proposal).</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know as soon as possible whether you are willing to accept my invitation to review this article, or whether you would prefer to decline, by clicking on the link below or by logging onto the {{longname}} website and going to 'For contributors —&gt; Invitation(s) to review a preprint' in the top menu.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>\r\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\r\n<p>{{recommenderName}}</p>
145	#SubmitterRecommendedPreprintPrivateStage1	default	{{appName}}: Stage 1 in-principle acceptance of your manuscript	Mail to author containing notification of an embargoed Stage 1 IPA decision	<div>Dear {{destPerson}},</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PCI RR for consideration as a Registered Report (Stage 1). After careful consideration, we are pleased to award in-principle acceptance (IPA) of your submission.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Please read the following letter carefully.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Preregistration of the Stage 1 manuscript</strong>. As noted in the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_2238970114821613309509575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">author guidelines</a>, PCI RR has now registered your approved Stage 1 manuscript on the OSF, and the URL to this protocol is provided in the Stage 1 recommendation text. Depending on the selections you made in the Stage 1 submission checklist, your approved Stage 1 manuscript has been registered either publicly or under a private embargo. If you opted for a private embargo, note that the embargo will be released and the registered protocol made public when any one of the following conditions are met: submission of the Stage 2 manuscript; withdrawal of the submission and consequent triggering of a Withdrawn Registration; or natural expiry of the embargo at the end of the period you selected in the Stage 1 submission checklist.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Progressing to Stage 2.</strong> You may now move to Stage 2 and complete the study as approved. We would be grateful if you could now update the PCI RR Managing board (<a href="mailto:contact@rr.peercommunityin.org">contact@rr.peercommunityin.org</a>) as to the anticipated completion date of your study. This deadline can be readily altered in consultation with the Managing Baord (e.g. in case of delays requiring additional time to complete the research). However, in the event that you should fail to submit the Stage 2 manuscript within 6 months of the mutually agreed deadline and also become non-responsive during this period to enquiries, then the manuscript will be considered by PCI RR to be de facto withdrawn, triggering publication of a Withdrawn Registration.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Following completion of your study, we invite you to resubmit one or more Stage 2 Registered Reports, depending on whether this IPA applies to a regular RR (involving one Stage 2 output) or a programmatic RR (involving multiple Stage 2 outputs). If you are receiving IPA for a programmatic RR then please familiarise yourself with the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_52492857233251613309610581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting requirements for programmatic RRs at Stage 2</a>.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Stage 2 review criteria (see <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_6720026472751613309075757" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>)</strong>. Please note that a Stage 2 manuscript can be rejected by PCI RR if the recommender and Managing Board consider any of the following conditions to be met:</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The results were unable to test the authors' proposed hypotheses (or answer the proposed research question) by failing to meet any approved outcome-neutral criteria, such as the absence of floor and ceiling effects, success of positive controls or other quality checks</li>\r\n<li>The authors altered the Introduction, rationale, or hypotheses, as approved in the Stage 1 submission</li>\r\n<li>The authors failed to adhere to the registered study procedures or preregistered analyses (and see below concerning necessary deviations from protocol)</li>\r\n<li>Any <em>post hoc</em> (unregistered) analyses are either unjustified, insufficiently caveated, or overly dominant in shaping the authors' conclusions</li>\r\n<li>The authors' conclusions were not justified given the data obtained</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Deviations from protocol.</strong> Please note that any deviation from the registered study procedures that is not approved in advance by the recommender and Managing Board could lead to rejection at Stage 2. In cases where the preregistered protocol must be altered after IPA due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g. change of equipment or unanticipated technical error), it is imperative that you consult the recommender immediately and prior to the completion of data collection, regardless of how minor the deviation may seem. Minor changes to the protocol that do not increase risk of bias are likely to be swiftly approved. In such cases, IPA would be preserved and the deviation reported in the Stage 2 submission.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Notification of PCI RR-interested journals.</strong> If you consented to notifying PCI RR-interested journals about your IPA then the complete list of <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/pci_rr_interested_journals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCI RR-interested journals</a> will now be given access to the author names, stated contact details, Stage 1 reviews and recommendation text (provided you also consented to publish the reviews and recommendation at the point of IPA), as well as the URL to the Stage 1 manuscript that has been registered by PCI RR (even if preregistered under a private embargo).</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Recommendation text</strong>. The recommender handling your submission has written a Stage 1 recommendation to accompany this decision letter. The recommendation will state the URL to the registered Stage 1 manuscript on the OSF, the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_95790490510491613309490336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">level of bias control</a> that was reached in your submission, and will list all eligible <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/pci_rr_friendly_journals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCI RR-friendly journals</a> that endorse this IPA decision and will later accept your approved Stage 2 manuscript(s) without further peer review. As noted in the author guidelines, the PCI RR Managing Board determines which PCI RR-friendly journals are eligible based on the disciplinary fit, word limit requirements, minimum pre-planned strength of evidence (e.g. level of statistical power), level of bias control achieved, and any other listed journal requirements (such as the acceptance of signed reviews only). Note that if you opted to keep the Stage 1 recommendation and reviews private until Stage 2 acceptance, then they will not appear on the PCI RR website until the completion of Stage 2.

It is a community of researchers across all research areas dedicated to the recommendation of registered reports that are publicly available in open archives (such as bioRxiv, arXiv, PaleorXiv, etc.) based on a high quality peer review process. This project was driven by a desire to establish a free, transparent, and public scientific publication system based on the review and recommendation of preprints.

If you submit ahead of the submission deadline, reviewers may be informed but there is no guarantee that they will review the manuscript until the specified review period is reached.</p>\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n<p>To help avoid the need for revisions prior to review, here are some common difficulties faced by authors in preparing a Stage 1 manuscript:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The protocol contains insufficient methodological detail to enable replication and prevent researcher degrees of freedom. One commonly neglected area is the criteria for excluding data, both at the level of participants/samples and at the level of data <em>within</em> participants/samples. In the interests of clarity, we recommend listing these criteria systematically rather than presenting them in prose.</li>\r\n<li>For quantitative studies involving hypothesis testing, a lack of correspondence between the scientific hypotheses and the preregistered statistical tests. This is a very common oversight. To maximize clarity of correspondence between predictions and analyses, authors are encouraged to number their hypotheses in the Introduction and then number the proposed analyses in the Methods to make clear which analysis tests which prediction. Ensure also that power analysis, where applicable, is based on the actual test procedures that will be employed to test those hypotheses; e.g. don’t propose a power analysis based on an ANOVA but then suggest a linear mixed effects model to test the hypothesis.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Lack of a completed study design template (as explained&nbsp;<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_27513965735331613309625021">here</a>). Make sure it is as concise as possible (e.g. including formulae for hypotheses) but complete and exhaustive. There are some examples <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010571.s002">here</a> alongside the paper ’<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010571">ten simple rules for writing a registered report</a>’.</li>\r\n<li>The statistical sampling (such as power analysis) is over-optimistic (e.g. based on previous literature but not taking into account publication bias) or insufficiently justified (e.g. based on a single point estimate from a pilot experiment or previous study). Proposals should be powered to detect the smallest effect that is plausible and of theoretical value. Pilot data can help inform this estimate but is unlikely to form an acceptable basis, alone, for choosing the target effect size. <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/8/1/33267/120491/Sample-Size-Justification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is an excellent paper</a> on sample size justification.</li>\r\n<li>Intention to infer support for the null hypothesis from statistically non-significant results, without proposing use of Bayes factors or frequentist equivalence&nbsp;testing (see&nbsp;<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/7/1/28202/118660/Obtaining-Evidence-for-No-Effect">here</a>&nbsp;for a nice explainer).</li>\r\n<li>Inclusion of exploratory analyses in the analysis plan. Manuscripts proposing exploratory analyses will usually be desk rejected until such analyses are removed because inclusion of exploratory “plans” at Stage 1 blurs the line between confirmatory and exploratory outcomes at Stage 2. Instead, such analyses can be included at Stage 2 and need not be preregistered. Under some circumstances, exploratory analyses can be discussed at Stage 1 where they are necessary to justify study variables or procedures that are included in the design exclusively for exploratory analysis. If so, be sure to justify their inclusion in the manuscript.</li>\r\n<li>Failure to distinguish work that has already been done from work that is planned. Where a proposal contains a mixture of pilot work that has already been undertaken and a proposal for work not yet undertaken, authors commonly use the past tense for pilot work but the future tense for the proposed work. At Stage 2, all descriptions shift to past tense.</li>\r\n<li>Lack of pre-specified positive controls or other quality checks, or an appropriate justification for their absence. Positive controls are not&nbsp;possible with all study designs, in which case authors should discuss why they are not included.</li>\r\n<li>Where applicable, lack of power analysis within proposed positive controls that depend on hypothesis testing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n<p>Follow this link to view your submission on the system: <a href="{{linkTarget}}">{{linkTarget}}</a></p>\r\n<p>When the full Stage 1 manuscript is written and ready to submit, please navigate to your submission on the PCI RR website and proceed as follows:</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Click the button "CHECK / EDIT REPORT SURVEY".

301	#RecommenderThankForPreprintStage1ScheduledSubmission	default	{{appName}}: Thank you for handling the evaluation of this Stage 1 snapshot 	Mail to recommender thanking them for agreeing to handle a Stage 1 snapshot	<p>Dear {{destPerson}},</p>\r\n<p>You have agreed to be the recommender handling the Stage 1 snapshot entitled <strong>{{articleTitle}}</strong> by {{articleAuthors}} (DOI <a href="{{snapshotUrl}}">{{snapshotUrl}}</a>). Thank you very much for your contribution.</p>\r\n<p>As a reminder, Stage 1 snapshots are one-page templates submitted by authors in advance of preparing and submitting a complete Stage 1 manuscript. If the snapshot passes an internal evaluation by PCI RR, the review process for the upcoming full manuscript is scheduled for a short range of dates in the future, with the aim to<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_reviewers#h_61998243643551613309672490"> streamline and accelerate the review process</a>. In this case, the authors have indicated that they would be ready to submit their full Stage 1 manuscript on {{scheduledSubmissionDate}}, and if suitable for if in-depth review, reviewers would be scheduled in advance to assess a full submission during a period of <strong>5 working days</strong> between {{scheduledSubmissionLatestReviewStartDate}} and {{scheduledReviewDueDate}} .</p>\r\n<p>Importantly, reviewers use the snapshot to decide if they are willing and able to evaluate a full manuscript during the proposed future dates.<strong> Reviewers do NOT a provide an evaluation of the snapshot itself. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Please now perform the following actions:</p>\r\n<div><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. <strong>Decide within 7 days if the snapshot sufficiently meets the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_recommenders#h_6759646236401613643390905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stage 1 review criteria</a> to merit further consideration</strong>. This can sometimes be challenging to judge given the brevity of a one-page snapshot, but you should especially assess criteria 1A (scientific validity of the research question), 1B (logic, rationale, and plausibility of any proposed hypotheses), 1C (soundness and feasibility of the proposed methodology), and 1E (appropriate steps in place to ensure data quality). Stage 1 criterion 1D (degree of methodological detail) is generally not possible to assess in a snapshot and, for the purposes of your initial evaluation, can be put aside. If the snapshot is sufficiently promising then you can invite reviewers to evaluate a future full manuscript<strong>, </strong>but if the snapshot falls short then you should either invite authors to revise the snapshot or reject it outright. <strong>Please do not accept the recommender assignment if you cannot perform this triage evaluation within the next 7 days.</strong><br></span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>2. If you judge the submission to be suitable for in-depth review <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>then please </strong></span><strong>send invitations to </strong><strong>5-10 potential reviewers within 24 hours</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then send new invitations until you find at least two (and ideally three) reviewers willing to review a full Stage 1 manuscript based on the snapshot between {{scheduledSubmissionLatestReviewStartDate}} and {{scheduledReviewDueDate}}. The review invitation letters will be automatically populated with these dates.</span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>3. <strong>Write the recommendation text</strong> if you decide to recommend this report for {{appName}} at the end of the in-depth review process. If after one or more rounds of review, you decide to recommend this report for Stage 1 in-principle acceptance, you will need to write a “<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_recommenders#h_68746834114021613643858842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendation</a>” that will have its own DOI and be published by {{appName}} under a CC-BY 4.0 license. The recommendation is a short summary (of a few hundred words or less), similar to a News &amp; Views piece, describing the context of the study and explaining why the article was accepted and is expected to make a valuable contribution. The limitations of the report can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the report being recommended). All the editorial correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) will also be published by {{appName}}, either at the point of in-principle acceptance or (if the authors) prefer following later Stage 2 acceptance.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>4. If a full manuscript is eventually submitted and reviewed, then you agree to <strong>post your decision</strong> or write your recommendation text <strong>within 7 days</strong> of receiving the reviews.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>If you need assistance in any way do not hesitate to ask us.

In rare cases where the full submission differs substantially from the research proposed in the snapshot, or falls a long way short of meeting at least one of the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_6720026472751613309075757" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stage 1 review criteria</a>, the full submission could also be rejected outright, in which case scheduled in-depth review would be cancelled.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Please note that missing the submission deadline of {{scheduledSubmissionDate}} could result in cancellation of the scheduled review process. </strong>If you can no longer meet this deadline, please contact the Managing Board immediately by replying to this email.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have submitted, and the submission has passed internal triage assessment by the Managing Board and recommender, the review process will commence. If you submit ahead of the submission deadline, reviewers may be informed but there is no guarantee that they will review the manuscript until the specified review period is reached.</p>\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n<p>To help avoid the need for revisions prior to review, here are some common difficulties faced by authors in preparing a Stage 1 manuscript:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The protocol contains insufficient methodological detail to enable replication and prevent researcher degrees of freedom. One commonly neglected area is the criteria for excluding data, both at the level of participants/samples and at the level of data <em>within</em> participants/samples. In the interests of clarity, we recommend listing these criteria systematically rather than presenting them in prose.</li>\r\n<li>For quantitative studies involving hypothesis testing, a lack of correspondence between the scientific hypotheses and the preregistered statistical tests. This is a very common oversight. To maximize clarity of correspondence between predictions and analyses, authors are encouraged to number their hypotheses in the Introduction and then number the proposed analyses in the Methods to make clear which analysis tests which prediction. Ensure also that power analysis, where applicable, is based on the actual test procedures that will be employed to test those hypotheses; e.g. don’t propose a power analysis based on an ANOVA but then suggest a linear mixed effects model to test the hypothesis.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Lack of a completed study design template (as explained&nbsp;<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_27513965735331613309625021">here</a>). Make sure it is as concise as possible (e.g. including formulae for hypotheses) but complete and exhaustive. There are some examples <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010571.s002">here</a> alongside the paper ’<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010571">ten simple rules for writing a registered report</a>’.</li>\r\n<li>The statistical sampling (such as power analysis) is over-optimistic (e.g. based on previous literature but not taking into account publication bias) or insufficiently justified (e.g. based on a single point estimate from a pilot experiment or previous study). Proposals should be powered to detect the smallest effect that is plausible and of theoretical value. Pilot data can help inform this estimate but is unlikely to form an acceptable basis, alone, for choosing the target effect size. <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/8/1/33267/120491/Sample-Size-Justification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is an excellent paper</a> on sample size justification.</li>\r\n<li>Intention to infer support for the null hypothesis from statistically non-significant results, without proposing use of Bayes factors or frequentist equivalence&nbsp;testing (see&nbsp;<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/7/1/28202/118660/Obtaining-Evidence-for-No-Effect">here</a>&nbsp;for a nice explainer).</li>\r\n<li>Inclusion of exploratory analyses in the analysis plan. Manuscripts proposing exploratory analyses will usually be desk rejected until such analyses are removed because inclusion of exploratory “plans” at Stage 1 blurs the line between confirmatory and exploratory outcomes at Stage 2. Instead, such analyses can be included at Stage 2 and need not be preregistered. Under some circumstances, exploratory analyses can be discussed at Stage 1 where they are necessary to justify study variables or procedures that are included in the design exclusively for exploratory analysis. If so, be sure to justify their inclusion in the manuscript.</li>\r\n<li>Failure to distinguish work that has already been done from work that is planned. Where a proposal contains a mixture of pilot work that has already been undertaken and a proposal for work not yet undertaken, authors commonly use the past tense for pilot work but the future tense for the proposed work. At Stage 2, all descriptions shift to past tense.</li>\r\n<li>Lack of pre-specified positive controls or other quality checks, or an appropriate justification for their absence. Positive controls are not&nbsp;possible with all study designs, in which case authors should discuss why they are not included.</li>\r\n<li>Where applicable, lack of power analysis within proposed positive controls that depend on hypothesis testing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>---</p>\r\n<p>Follow this link to view your submission on the system: <a href="{{linkTarget}}">{{linkTarget}}</a></p>\r\n<p>When the time comes to submit your full Stage 1 manuscript, please navigate to your submission on the PCI RR website and proceed as follows:</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Click the button "CHECK / EDIT REPORT SURVEY".

After careful consideration, we are pleased to award in-principle acceptance (IPA) of your submission.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Please read the following letter carefully.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Preregistration of the Stage 1 manuscript</strong>. As noted in the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_2238970114821613309509575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">author guidelines</a>, PCI RR has now registered your approved Stage 1 manuscript on the OSF, and the URL to this protocol is provided in the Stage 1 recommendation text. Depending on the selections you made in the Stage 1 submission checklist, your approved Stage 1 manuscript has been registered either publicly or under a private embargo. If you opted for a private embargo, note that the embargo will be released and the registered protocol made public when any one of the following conditions are met: submission of the Stage 2 manuscript; withdrawal of the submission and consequent triggering of a Withdrawn Registration; or natural expiry of the embargo at the end of the period you selected in the Stage 1 submission checklist.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Progressing to Stage 2.</strong> You may now move to Stage 2 and complete the study as approved. We would be grateful if you could now update the PCI RR Managing board (<a href="mailto:contact@rr.peercommunityin.org">contact@rr.peercommunityin.org</a>) as to the anticipated completion date of your study. This deadline can be readily altered in consultation with the Managing Board (e.g. in case of delays requiring additional time to complete the research). However, in the event that you should fail to submit the Stage 2 manuscript within 6 months of the mutually agreed deadline and also become non-responsive during this period to enquiries, then the manuscript will be considered by PCI RR to be de facto withdrawn, triggering publication of a Withdrawn Registration.</div>\r\n<div>Following completion of your study, we invite you to resubmit one or more Stage 2 Registered Reports, depending on whether this IPA applies to a regular RR (involving one Stage 2 output) or a programmatic RR (involving multiple Stage 2 outputs). If you are receiving IPA for a programmatic RR then please familiarise yourself with the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_52492857233251613309610581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting requirements for programmatic RRs at Stage 2</a>.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Stage 2 review criteria (see <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_6720026472751613309075757" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>)</strong>. Please note that a Stage 2 manuscript can be rejected by PCI RR if the recommender and Managing Board consider any of the following conditions to be met:</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The results were unable to test the authors' proposed hypotheses (or answer the proposed research question) by failing to meet any approved outcome-neutral criteria, such as the absence of floor and ceiling effects, success of positive controls or other quality checks</li>\r\n<li>The authors altered the Introduction, rationale, or hypotheses, as approved in the Stage 1 submission</li>\r\n<li>The authors failed to adhere to the registered study procedures or preregistered analyses (and see below concerning necessary deviations from protocol)</li>\r\n<li>Any <em>post hoc</em> (unregistered) analyses are either unjustified, insufficiently caveated, or overly dominant in shaping the authors' conclusions</li>\r\n<li>The authors' conclusions were not justified given the data obtained</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Deviations from protocol.</strong> Please note that any deviation from the registered study procedures that is not approved in advance by the recommender and Managing Board could lead to rejection at Stage 2. In cases where the preregistered protocol must be altered after IPA due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g. change of equipment or unanticipated technical error), it is imperative that you consult the recommender immediately and prior to the completion of data collection, regardless of how minor the deviation may seem. Minor changes to the protocol that do not increase risk of bias are likely to be swiftly approved. In such cases, IPA would be preserved and the deviation reported in the Stage 2 submission.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Notification of PCI RR-interested journals.</strong> If you consented to notifying PCI RR-interested journals about your IPA then the complete list of <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/pci_rr_interested_journals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCI RR-interested journals</a> will now be given access to the author names, stated contact details, Stage 1 reviews and recommendation text (provided you also consented to publish the reviews and recommendation at the point of IPA), as well as the URL to the Stage 1 manuscript that has been registered by PCI RR (even if preregistered under a private embargo).</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Recommendation text</strong>. The recommender handling your submission has written a Stage 1 recommendation to accompany this decision letter. The recommendation is a short summary describing the context of the study and explaining why the article was accepted and is expected to make a valuable contribution. The recommendation will also state the URL to the registered Stage 1 manuscript on the OSF, the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_authors#h_95790490510491613309490336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">level of bias control</a> that was reached in your submission, and will list all eligible <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/pci_rr_friendly_journals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCI RR-friendly journals</a> that endorse this IPA decision and will later accept your approved Stage 2 manuscript(s) without further peer review. As noted in the author guidelines, the PCI RR Managing Board determines which PCI RR-friendly journals are eligible based on the disciplinary fit, word limit requirements, minimum pre-planned strength of evidence (e.g. level of statistical power), level of bias control achieved, and any other listed journal requirements (such as the acceptance of signed reviews only). <strong>If you opted for the Stage 1 recommendation to be made public at the point of IPA then you will find it now published on the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCI RR website under the heading "Latest Recommendations"</a>. </strong>However, if you opted to keep the Stage 1 recommendation and reviews private until Stage 2 acceptance, then they will not appear on the PCI RR website until the completion of Stage 2.

The aim of this initiative is to minimise publication bias and reporting bias, while also allowing the flexibility to conduct exploratory (unregistered) analyses and report serendipitous findings. Submitted manuscripts can propose novel studies or direct replications of previous studies.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-weight: 400;">PCI RR is a free, non-commercial platform dedicated to the peer review of RR preprints.
