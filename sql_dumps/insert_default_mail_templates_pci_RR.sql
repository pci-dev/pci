We are pleased to award in-principle acceptance (IPA) of your paper. Please read the following letter carefully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please ensure that your Stage 2 manuscript, when submitted, states the URL to this Stage 1 manscript in the main text (see author guidelines for further details). Depending on the selections you made in the Stage 1 submission checklist, your approved Stage 1 protocol has been registered either publicly or under a private embargo. If you opted for a private embargo, note that the embargo will be released and the registered protocol made public when any one of the following conditions are met: submission of the Stage 2 manuscript; withdrawal of the submission and consequent triggering of a Withdrawn Registration; or natural expiry of the embargo at the end of the period you selected in the Stage 1 submission checklist.</p>\n<p>You may now progress to Stage 2 and complete the study as approved. We would be grateful if you could now update the journal office as to the anticipated completion date of your study. This deadline can be readily altered in consultation with the editors (e.g. in case of delays requiring additional time to complete the research). However, in the event that you should fail to submit the Stage 2 manuscript within 6 months of the mutually agreed deadline and also become non-responsive during this period to editorial enquiries, then the manuscript will be considered by the journal to be de facto withdrawn, triggering publication of a Withdrawn Registration. For technical reasons, your manuscript may appear on the system as rejected. Please disregard any such information. Following completion of your study, we invite you to resubmit your paper for peer review as a Stage 2 Registered Report.</p>\n<p>Please note that your manuscript can still be rejected for publication at Stage 2 if the editors consider any of the following conditions to be met:</p>\n<p>* The results were unable to test the \authors\' proposed hypotheses by failing to meet the approved outcome-neutral criteria<br>* The authors altered the Introduction, rationale, or hypotheses, as approved in the Stage 1 submission<br>* The authors failed to adhere to the registered study procedures or pre-registered analyses (and see below)<br>* Any post hoc (unregistered) analyses were either unjustified, insufficiently caveated, or overly dominant in shaping the \authors\' conclusions<br>* The \authors\' conclusions were not justified given the data obtained</p>\n<p>Please note that any deviation from the registered study procedures that is not approved in advance by the editors could lead to rejection of your manuscript at Stage 2.</p>\n<p>Please note that in cases where the pre-registered protocol must be altered after IPA due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g. change of equipment or unanticipated technical error), you must consult the editorial board immediately for advice, and PRIOR to the completion of data collection.<br>Minor changes to the protocol may be permitted according to editorial discretion. In such cases, IPA would be preserved and the deviation reported in the Stage 2 submission. We encourage you to read the complete guidelines for authors concerning Stage 2 submissions here. Please especially note the requirements for data sharing and that withdrawing your manuscript will result in publication of a Withdrawn Registration.</p>\n<p>Below is a recap of how the recommendation process went:</p>\n{{recommendationProcess}}\n<p>To submit your Stage 2 Registered Report, please xxx</p>\n<p>Thank you for using {{appName}}.

You can obtain information about this request and accept or decline this invitation by following this link&nbsp;<a href="{{linkTarget}}">{{linkTarget}}</a> or by logging on to the {{appName}} website and going to \'For recommenders —&gt; Request(s) to handle a report\' in the top menu.</p>\n<p>The role of a recommender is very similar to that of a journal editor (finding reviewers, collecting reviews, taking editorial decisions based on reviews), and may lead to the recommendation of the report after several rounds of reviews. The evaluation forms the basis of the decision to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the report. A report recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like the ‘classic’ articles published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>\n<p>If after one or several rounds of review, you decide to recommend this report, you will need to write a “recommendation” that will have its own DOI and be published by {{appName}} under the license CC-BY-ND. The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News &amp; Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context and explains why the report is particularly interesting. The limitations of the report can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the report being recommended). All the editorial correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) will also be published by {{appName}}.</p>\n<p>If you agree to handle this report, you will be responsible for managing the evaluation process until you reach a final decision (i.e. to recommend or reject this report). You will be able to invite, through the {{appName}} website, reviewers included in the {{appName}} database or from your own network.</p>\n<p>Details about the recommendation process can be found here&nbsp;<a href="{{helpUrl}}">{{helpUrl}}</a>. You can also watch this short video:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/u5greO-q8-M">How to start and manage a report recommendation</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>The Managing Board of {{appName}}</p>'),

The evaluation forms the basis of the decision to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the report. A report recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like the ‘classic’ articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Details about the recommendation process can be found <a href="{{helpurl}}">here</a>. You can also watch this short video: <a href="https://youtu.be/u5greO-q8-M"> How to start and manage a report recommendation</a>.</p>\n<p>Agreeing to become the recommender for this report means that <strong>you find the report interesting</strong> and therefore worth sending out for peer-review. Then, you will need to meet the following <strong>requirements</strong>:<br>1- <strong> to send invitations to 5-10 potential reviewers within the next 24 hours </strong> and then to send reminders and/or new invitations until you find at least two reviewers willing to review the report. This process of finding reviews should take no more than a week.<br>2- <strong>to post your decision</strong> or to write your recommendation text <strong>within 10 days</strong> of receiving the reviews.<br>3- <strong>to write a recommendation text</strong> if you decide to recommend this report for {{appName}} at the end of the evaluation process. Indeed, if after one or several rounds of review, you decide to recommend this report, you will need to write a “recommendation” that will have its own DOI and be published by {{appName}} under the license CC-BY-ND. The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News &amp; Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context and explains why the report is particularly interesting. The limitations of the report can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the report being recommended). All the editorial correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) will also be published by {{appName}}.<br>4- <strong>to declare that you have no conflict of interest with the authors or the content of the article.</strong> Indeed, you should not handle articles written by close colleagues (with whom I have published in the last four years, with whom I have received joint funding in the last four years, or with whom I am currently writing a manuscript, or submitting a grant proposal), or written by family members, friends, or anyone for whom bias might affect the nature of my evaluation. See the <a href="{{ethicsurl}}">code of ethical conduct</a>.

More information can be found on the website of {{appLongName}} (<a href="{{siteUrl}}">{{siteUrl}}</a>) and in this short video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PZhpnc8wwo).</p>\n<p>The evaluation process should guide the decision as to whether to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the report. A report recommended by {{appLongName}} is a complete article that may be used and cited like any ‘classic’ article published in a peer-reviewed journals.</p>\n<p>If I eventually reach a favorable conclusion, all the editorial correspondence (reviews, recommender’s decisions, authors’ replies) and a recommendation text will be published by {{appLongName}}, under the license CC-BY-ND.

(E'#SubmitterRecommendedPreprintPrivateStage1',E'default',E'{{appName}}: subject',E'Mail to submitter to indicate the private recommandation of his/her report',E'<p>Dear {{destPerson}},</p>\n<p>Thank you for submitting your work to PCI RR for consideration as a Registered Report (Stage 1). We are pleased to award in-principle acceptance (IPA) of your paper. Please read the following letter carefully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please ensure that your Stage 2 manuscript, when submitted, states the URL to this Stage 1 manuscript in the main text (see author guidelines for further details). Depending on the selections you made in the Stage 1 submission checklist, your approved Stage 1 protocol has been registered either publicly or under a private embargo. If you opted for a private embargo, note that the embargo will be released and the registered protocol made public when any one of the following conditions are met: submission of the Stage 2 manuscript; withdrawal of the submission and consequent triggering of a Withdrawn Registration; or natural expiry of the embargo at the end of the period you selected in the Stage 1 submission checklist.</p>\n<p>You may now progress to Stage 2 and complete the study as approved. We would be grateful if you could now update the journal office as to the anticipated completion date of your study. This deadline can be readily altered in consultation with the editors (e.g. in case of delays requiring additional time to complete the research). However, in the event that you should fail to submit the Stage 2 manuscript within 6 months of the mutually agreed deadline and also become non-responsive during this period to editorial enquiries, then the manuscript will be considered by the journal to be de facto withdrawn, triggering publication of a Withdrawn Registration. For technical reasons, your manuscript may appear on the system as rejected. Please disregard any such information. Following completion of your study, we invite you to resubmit your paper for peer review as a Stage 2 Registered Report.</p>\n<p>Please note that your manuscript can still be rejected for publication at Stage 2 if the editors consider any of the following conditions to be met:</p>\n<p>* The results were unable to test the \authors\' proposed hypotheses by failing to meet the approved outcome-neutral criteria<br>* The authors altered the Introduction, rationale, or hypotheses, as approved in the Stage 1 submission<br>* The authors failed to adhere to the registered study procedures or pre-registered analyses (and see below)<br>* Any post hoc (unregistered) analyses were either unjustified, insufficiently caveated, or overly dominant in shaping the \authors\' conclusions<br>* The \authors\' conclusions were not justified given the data obtained</p>\n<p>Please note that any deviation from the registered study procedures that is not approved in advance by the editors could lead to rejection of your manuscript at Stage 2.</p>\n<p>Please note that in cases where the pre-registered protocol must be altered after IPA due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g. change of equipment or unanticipated technical error), you must consult the editorial board immediately for advice, and PRIOR to the completion of data collection.<br>Minor changes to the protocol may be permitted according to editorial discretion. In such cases, IPA would be preserved and the deviation reported in the Stage 2 submission. We encourage you to read the complete guidelines for authors concerning Stage 2 submissions here. Please especially note the requirements for data sharing and that withdrawing your manuscript will result in publication of a Withdrawn Registration.</p>\n<p>Below is a recap of how the recommendation process went:</p>\n{{recommendationProcess}}\n<p>To submit your Stage 2 Registered Report, please:</p>\n<p>1) Upload the manuscript onto your favorite open archive;</p>\n<p>2) Follow this link {{linkTarget}} or logging onto the {{appName}} website and go to \'For Contributers -&gt; Your submitted preprints\' in the top menu;</p>\n<p>3) Click "Stage 2"</p>\n<p>4) When you are ready to submit your Stage 2, click on the \'Save &amp; submit your reply\' button.</p>\n<p>We look forward to receiving your manuscript.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>The Managing Board of {{appName}}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'),
