1	#NewMembreshipRecommender	default	You are now a recommender of %(appname)s.	Mail to alert a user that he's now a recommender.	<p>Dear %(destPerson)s,</p>\r\n<p>You are now a recommender of <em>%(appname)s</em>. We thank you for your time and support.</p>\r\n<p>The role of a recommender is very similar to that of a journal editor (finding reviewers, collecting reviews, making editorial decisions based on reviews), with the possibility of recommending the preprints you have chosen to handle after one or after several rounds of reviews. The evaluation process is designed to guide decisions as to whether to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the preprint.</p>\r\n<p>A preprint recommended by <em>%(appname)s</em> is an article that may be used and cited like any ‘classic’ article published in a peer-reviewed journal. If you decide to recommend a preprint, you will need to write a “recommendation”, which will have its own DOI and be published by <em>%(appname)s</em> under the license CC-BY-ND. The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News &amp; Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context and explains why the preprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of the preprint can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the preprint being recommended). All the editorial correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) will also be published by <em>%(appname)s</em>.</p>\r\n<p>As a recommender for <em>%(appname)s</em>,</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can recommend up to five articles per year. Details about the recommendation process can be found here <a href="%(helpurl)s">%(helpurl)s</a> and in this short <a href="https://youtu.be/u5greO-q8-M">video</a>.</li>\r\n<li>You will be expected to comply with the code of conduct of <em>%(appname)s</em>, which can be found here: <a href="%(ethicsurl)s">%(ethicsurl)s</a></li>\r\n<li>You are eligible for selection as a member of the Managing Board for a period of two years.</li>\r\n<li>You will be notified about new articles recommended by <em>%(appname)s</em>, according to your requested notification frequency and fields of interest.</li>\r\n<li>You will also receive requests to intiate preprint evaluations in your fields of interest with a view to recommending them.</li>\r\n<li>You can propose the nomination of new recommenders to the Managing Board.\r\n<p>Thanks again for your interest, your help and your support.</p>\r\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\r\n<p>The Managing Board of <em>%(appname)s</em></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>

This process of finding reviews\r\n  should take no more than a week.<br />\r\n  2- <b>to post your decision</b> or to write your recommendation text\r\n  <b>within 10 days</b> of receiving the reviews.<br />\r\n  3- <b>to write a recommendation text</b> if you decide to recommend this\r\n  preprint for <i>%(appname)s</i> at the end of the evaluation process.

You can\r\n  obtain information about this request and accept or decline this invitation by\r\n  following this link <a href="%(linkTarget)s">%(linkTarget)s</a> or by logging\r\n  on to the <i>%(appname)s</i> website and going to 'Requests for input —> Do\r\n  you agree to initiate a recommendation?' in the top menu.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The role of a recommender is very similar to that of a journal editor (finding\r\n  reviewers, collecting reviews, taking editorial decisions based on reviews),\r\n  and may lead to the recommendation of the preprint after several rounds of\r\n  reviews. The evaluation forms the basis of the decision to ‘Revise’,\r\n  ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the preprint. A preprint recommended by\r\n  <i>%(appname)s</i> is an article that may be used and cited like the ‘classic’\r\n  articles published in peer-reviewed journals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  If after one or several rounds of review, you decide to recommend this\r\n  preprint, you will need to write a “recommendation” that will have its own DOI\r\n  and be published by <i>%(appname)s</i> under the license CC-BY-ND. The\r\n  recommendation is a short article, similar to a News & Views piece. It has its\r\n  own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context\r\n  and explains why the preprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of\r\n  the preprint can also be discussed. This text also contains references\r\n  (citing, at least, the preprint being recommended). All the editorial\r\n  correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) will also be\r\n  published by <i>%(appname)s</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  If you agree to handle this preprint, you will be responsible for managing the\r\n  evaluation process until you reach a final decision (i.e. to recommend or\r\n  reject this preprint). You will be able to invite, through the\r\n  <i>%(appname)s</i> website, reviewers included in the\r\n  <i>%(appname)s</i> database or from your own network.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Details about the recommendation process can be found here\r\n  <a href="%(helpurl)s">%(helpurl)s</a>.

40	#ReviewerReviewInvitation	default	%(appname)s: Invitation to review a preprint	\N	Dear %(destPerson)s,\r\n<p>\r\n  I have agreed to handle the evaluation of a preprint entitled\r\n  <b>%(articleTitle)s</b> by %(articleAuthors)s, for potential recommendation by\r\n  <i>%(appdesc)s</i> (<i>%(appname)s</i>). This article can be visualized and\r\n  downloaded at the following address (doi %(articleDoi)s).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  At first glance, this preprint appears to me to be potentially interesting,\r\n  but I would like to have your expert opinion. I would therefore like to invite\r\n  you to review this preprint for <i>%(appname)s</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  If you have already reviewed a previous version of this MS, please consider\r\n  this message as an invitation to review a new version of the preprint for a\r\n  new round of evaluation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The evaluation process should guide the decision as to whether to ‘Revise’,\r\n  ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the preprint. A preprint recommended by\r\n  <i>%(appname)s</i> is an article that may be used and cited like any ‘classic’\r\n  article published in a peer-reviewed journals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  If I eventually reach a favorable conclusion, all the editorial correspondence\r\n  (reviews, recommender’s decisions, authors’ replies) and a recommendation text\r\n  will be published by <i>%(appname)s</i>, under the license CC-BY-ND. If after\r\n  one or several rounds of review, I eventually reject the preprint, the\r\n  editorial correspondence (and specifically your review) will be sent to the\r\n  authors but will NOT published. You will be notified by e-mail at each stage\r\n  in the procedure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Please let me know as soon as possible whether you are willing to accept my\r\n  invitation to review this article, or whether you would prefer to decline, by\r\n  clicking on the link below or by logging on to the <i>%(appname)s</i> website\r\n  and going to 'Requests for input —> Do you agree to review a preprint?' in the\r\n  top menu.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  If you agree, you will then be able to copy/paste, write or upload your review\r\n  onto the <i>%(appname)s</i> website.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Thanks in advance for your help.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Yours sincerely,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <span style="padding-left:1in;">%(recommenderPerson)s</span>\r\n</p>\r\n

The\r\n  referees' comments and the recommender’s decision are shown below. As you can\r\n  see, the recommender found your article very interesting, but suggests certain\r\n  revisions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  We shall, in principle, be happy to recommend your article as soon as it has\r\n  been revised in response to the points raised by the referees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  When revising your article, we remind you that:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  1) Data must be available to readers, either in the text or through an open\r\n  data repository such as Zenodo (free), Dryad (to pay) or some other\r\n  institutional repository. Data must be reusable, thus metadata or accompanying\r\n  text must carefully describe the data;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  2) Details on quantitative analyses (e.g., data treatment and statistical\r\n  scripts in R, bioinformatic pipeline scripts, etc.) and details concerning\r\n  simulations (scripts, codes) must be available to readers in the text, as\r\n  appendices, or through an open data repository, such as Zenodo, Dryad or some\r\n  other institutional repository. The scripts or codes must be carefully\r\n  described so that they can be reused;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  3) Details on experimental procedures must be available to readers in the text\r\n  or as appendices;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  4) Authors must have no financial conflict of interest relating to the\r\n  article. The article must contain a "Conflict of interest disclosure"\r\n  paragraph before the reference section containing this sentence: "The authors\r\n  of this article declare that they have no financial conflict of interest with\r\n  the content of this article.";\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  5) This disclosure has to be completed by a sentence indicating, if\r\n  appropriate, that some of the authors are PCI recommenders: “XY is one of the\r\n  <i>%(appname)s</i> recommenders.”.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  When your revised article is ready, please:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  1) Upload the new version of your manuscript onto your favorite open archive;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  2) Follow this link <a href="%(linkTarget)s">%(linkTarget)s</a> or logging\r\n  onto the <i>%(appname)s</i> website and go to 'your contributions' section and\r\n  then to 'Your submitted preprints' subsection in the top menu;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  3) Make your changes to the title, summary, link to the article (or its DOI)\r\n  and keywords if necessary by clicking on the 'Edit Article' button. If not\r\n  already done, you also need to upload a picture or an illustration for which\r\n  you own the rights – this picture will be used to illustrate your article, if\r\n  recommended;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  4) Write, copy/paste or upload (as a PDF file) your reply to the recommender's\r\n  and reviewers' comments by clicking on the 'Write, edit or upload your reply\r\n  to recommender' button. You can also upload (as a PDF file) a revised version\r\n  of your article, with the modifications indicated in TrackChanges mode;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  5) When you are ready to submit your new version, click on the 'Save & submit\r\n  your reply' button.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Once the recommender has read the revised version, he/she may decide to\r\n  recommend it directly, in which case the editorial correspondence (reviews,\r\n  recommender’s decisions, authors’ replies) and a recommendation text will be\r\n  published by <i>%(appname)s</i> under the license CC-BY-ND.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Alternatively, other rounds of reviews may be needed before the recommender\r\n  reaches a favorable conclusion. He/she may also reject your article, in which\r\n  case the reviews and decision will be sent to you, but they will not be\r\n  published or publicly released by <i>%(appname)s</i>. They will be safely\r\n  stored in our database, to which only the Managing Board has access. You will\r\n  be notified by e-mail at each stage in the procedure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  We thank you in advance for submitting your revised version.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Yours sincerely,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Managing Board of <i>%(appname)s</i>\r\n</p>\r\n
