Thank you very much for your contribution.</p>\r\n<p>As a reminder, Stage 1 snapshots are one-page templates submitted by authors in advance of preparing and submitting a complete Stage 1 manuscript. If the snapshot passes an internal evaluation by PCI RR, the review process for the upcoming full manuscript is scheduled for a short range of dates in the future, with the aim to<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_reviewers#h_61998243643551613309672490"> streamline and accelerate the review process</a>. In this case, the authors have indicated that they would be ready to submit their full Stage 1 manuscript on {{scheduledSubmissionDate}}, and if suitable for if in-depth review, reviewers would be scheduled in advance to assess a full submission during a period of <strong>5 working days</strong> between {{scheduledSubmissionLatestReviewStartDate}} and {{scheduledReviewDueDate}} .</p>\r\n<p>Importantly, reviewers use the snapshot to decide if they are willing and able to evaluate a full manuscript during the proposed future dates.<strong> Reviewers do NOT a provide an evaluation of the snapshot itself. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Please now perform the following actions:</p>\r\n<div><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. <strong>Decide within 7 days if the snapshot sufficiently meets the <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_recommenders#h_6759646236401613643390905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stage 1 review criteria</a> to merit further consideration</strong>. This can sometimes be challenging to judge given the brevity of a one-page snapshot, but you should especially assess criteria 1A (scientific validity of the research question), 1B (logic, rationale, and plausibility of any proposed hypotheses), 1C (soundness and feasibility of the proposed methodology), and 1E (appropriate steps in place to ensure data quality). Stage 1 criterion 1D (degree of methodological detail) is generally not possible to assess in a snapshot and, for the purposes of your initial evaluation, can be put aside. If the snapshot is sufficiently promising then you can invite reviewers to evaluate a future full manuscript<strong>, </strong>but if the snapshot falls short then you should either invite authors to revise the snapshot or reject it outright. <strong>Please do not accept the recommender assignment if you cannot perform this triage evaluation within the next 7 days.</strong><br></span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>2. If you judge the submission to be suitable for in-depth review <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>then please </strong></span><strong>send invitations to </strong><strong>5-10 potential reviewers within 24 hours</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then send new invitations until you find at least two (and ideally three) reviewers willing to review a full Stage 1 manuscript based on the snapshot between {{scheduledSubmissionLatestReviewStartDate}} and {{scheduledReviewDueDate}}. The review invitation letters will be automatically populated with these dates.</span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>3. <strong>Write the recommendation text</strong> if you decide to recommend this report for {{appName}} at the end of the in-depth review process. If after one or more rounds of review, you decide to recommend this report for Stage 1 in-principle acceptance, you will need to write a “<a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_recommenders#h_68746834114021613643858842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommendation</a>” that will have its own DOI and be published by {{appName}} under a CC-BY 4.0 license. The recommendation is a short summary (of a few hundred words or less), similar to a News &amp; Views piece, describing the context of the study and explaining why the article was accepted and is expected to make a valuable contribution. The limitations of the report can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the report being recommended). All the editorial correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) will also be published by {{appName}}, either at the point of in-principle acceptance or (if the authors) prefer following later Stage 2 acceptance.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>4. If a full manuscript is eventually submitted and reviewed, then you agree to <strong>post your decision</strong> or write your recommendation text <strong>within 7 days</strong> of receiving the reviews.</div>\r\n<p>If you need assistance in any way do not hesitate to ask us.
