Briefly, your preprints must first be deposited on a preprint server, such as bioRxiv, and you must choose between A) exclusive submission to {{appName}}, or B) parallel submission with journals. Please go to <a href="{{infourl}}">{{infourl}}</a> for more information on these options.</p>\n<p>When submitting your preprints, you are allowed to suggest recommenders. A recommender is very similar to a journal editor (responsible for finding reviewers, collecting reviews, and making editorial decisions based on reviews), and may eventually recommend your preprint after one or several rounds of reviews. A preprint recommended by {{appLongName}} is an article that may be used and cited like any ‘classic’ article published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>\n<p>Once you have submitted your preprint, one of the recommenders you suggest, or any other recommenders from the community may express an interest in initiating the evaluation process for your preprint, which will involve sending your preprint out for peer review.</p>\n<p>If you wish to submit a preprint, please click on the "Submit a preprint" button on the home page of the {{appName}} website.</p>\n<p>As a user, you will also receive alerts every {{days}} concerning recommendations in the following fields published on the {{appLongName}} web site: {{thematics}}.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you are interested in becoming a recommender for {{appName}} - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BDrPoHGkn0">see video</a> - please contact a current recommender in your field via this link <a href="{{recommurl}}">{{recommurl}}</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your interest and for joining {{appLongName}}.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>The Managing Board of {{appLongName}}</p>'),
