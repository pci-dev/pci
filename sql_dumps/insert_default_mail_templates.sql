The evaluation process is designed to guide decisions as to whether to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the preprint.</p>\n<p>A preprint recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like any ‘classic’ article published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News &amp; Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context and explains why the preprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of the preprint can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the preprint being recommended).

This process of finding reviews should take no more than a week.<br>2- <strong>to post your decision</strong> or to write your recommendation text <strong>within 10 days</strong> of receiving the reviews.<br>3- <strong>to write a recommendation text</strong> if you decide to recommend this preprint for {{appName}} at the end of the evaluation process.
