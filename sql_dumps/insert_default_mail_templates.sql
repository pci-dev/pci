1	#NewMembreshipRecommender	default	{{appName}}: Welcome as a recommender	Mail to user to acknowledge their status of recommender	<p>Dear {{destPerson}},</p>\r\n<p>You are now a recommender of {{appName}}. We thank you for your time and support.</p>\r\n<p>The role of a recommender is very similar to that of a journal editor (finding reviewers, collecting reviews, making editorial decisions based on reviews), with the possibility of recommending the preprints you have chosen to handle after one or after several rounds of reviews. The evaluation process is designed to guide decisions as to whether to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the preprint.</p>\r\n<p>A preprint recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like any ‘classic’ article published in a peer-reviewed journal. If you decide to recommend a preprint, you will need to write a “recommendation”, which will have its own DOI and be published by {{appName}} under the license CC-BY-ND. The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News &amp; Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context and explains why the preprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of the preprint can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the preprint being recommended). All the editorial correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) will also be published by {{appName}}.</p>\r\n<p>As a recommender for {{appName}},</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can recommend up to five articles per year. Details about the recommendation process can be found here <a href="{{helpurl}}">{{helpurl}}</a> and in this short <a href="https://youtu.be/u5greO-q8-M">video</a>.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>You will be expected to comply with the code of conduct of {{appName}}, which can be found here: <a href="{{ethicsurl}}">{{ethicsurl}}</a></li>\r\n<li>You are eligible for selection as a member of the Managing Board for a period of two years.</li>\r\n<li>You will be notified about new articles recommended by {{appName}}, according to your requested notification frequency and fields of interest.</li>\r\n<li>You will also receive requests to initiate preprint evaluations in your fields of interest with a view to recommending them.</li>\r\n<li>You can propose the nomination of new recommenders to the Managing Board.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There is also a guide for PCI recommenders <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/2020/10/28/pci-recommender-guide/">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again for your interest, your help and your support.</p>\r\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\r\n<p>The Managing Board of {{appName}}</p>

The article may, therefore, be of poor scientific quality and, if this is the case, it would be better to reject it directly, without peer review. So, <strong>if you feel that this preprint is of insufficient quality, please decline this request to handle it.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Important information before you agree to become the recommender for this preprint:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The role of a recommender is very similar to that of a journal editor (finding reviewers, collecting reviews, taking editorial decisions based on reviews). The decision to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the preprint is based on the recommender’s evaluation. A preprint recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like the ‘classic’ articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Recommended preprints are valid, citable and final articles. The normal outcome is therefore to leave them on preprint servers or open repositories. However, the authors of a PCI-recommended article may prefer:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To publish their article in the Peer Community journal as is, immediately and at no cost</li>\r\n<li>To submit it to a PCI-friendly journal (acceptance with no further peer review OR response within 5 days OR use of the PCI evaluation if appropriate).</li>\r\n<li>To submit it to another journal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Details about the recommendation process can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://peercommunityin.org/2020/10/28/pci-recommender-guide/">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>By agreeing to become the recommender for this preprint, you agree to do your best to handle the peer-review process within as short a time period as possible for the authors. Indeed, this rapid turnaround time is a key factor for the success of PCI as a credible alternative to journals.</p>\r\n<p>To this end, we need you:</p>\r\n<p>1-&nbsp;<strong>To send invitations to 5-10 potential reviewers within 24 hours of agreeing to become the recommender for this preprint</strong><strong> </strong>and to continue sending out new invitations until you find at least two reviewers willing to review the preprint. Sending multiple invitations increases the chances of finding available reviewers and keeping turnaround times short. You may, of course, use whichever strategy you prefer to invite reviewers. The key thing is avoiding situations in which only a couple of invitations have been sent out in 20 days, with only one reply after 30 days.<br>2-&nbsp;<strong>To post your decision,</strong>&nbsp;ideally <strong>within 10 days</strong>&nbsp;of receiving the reviews. <br>3-&nbsp;<strong>To write a recommendation text </strong><strong>(i.e. a text of 300 to 1,500 words describing the context and explaining why</strong> the preprint is particularly interesting)&nbsp;if you decide to recommend this preprint for {{appName}} at the end of the evaluation process, and to submit it as soon as possible after deciding to recommend the article.<br>4-&nbsp;<strong>To declare that you have no conflict of interest with the authors or the content of the article.</strong>&nbsp; See the <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/">code of conduct</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Details about the recommendation process can be found <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/2020/10/28/pci-recommender-guide/">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your help.</p>\r\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\r\n<p>The Managing Board of {{appName}}</p>

The limitations of the preprint can also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing, at least, the preprint being recommended).

If the authors abandon the process at {{appName}} after reviewers have written their reports, you should post the reviewers' reports on the {{appName}} website as recognition of the reviewers' work and in order to enable critical discussion.

62	#ReminderSuggestedRecommenderInvitation	default	{{appName}}: Request to act as a recommender for a preprint - reminder	Mail to suggested recommenders to remind them to act as recommender of a submitted preprint	<p>Dear {{destPerson}},</p>\r\n<p>A few days ago, {{articleAuthors}} suggested you as a recommender for their preprint entitled&nbsp;<strong>{{articleTitle}}</strong>: <a href="{{articleDoi}}">{{articleDoi}}</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Very important: </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>You should agree to become the recommender for this preprint only if, after reading it, you think that it is interesting and merits evaluation</strong> (relevant research question, quality of the methods/data/analysis, etc.).</p>\r\n<p>You can obtain information about this request and accept or decline this invitation by following this link&nbsp;<a href="{{linkTarget}}">{{linkTarget}}</a>&nbsp;or by logging on to the {{appName}} website and going to 'For recommenders —&gt; Request(s) to handle a preprint' in the tool bar.</p>\r\n<p>The article has been adjudged to lie within the scope of the PCI, but there was no scientific filtering by the managing board. It may, therefore, be of poor scientific quality and, if this is the case, it would be better to reject it at this stage, without peer review. So, <strong>if you feel that this preprint is of insufficient quality, please decline this request to handle it</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Important information before you agree to become the recommender for this preprint:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The role of a recommender is very similar to that of a journal editor (finding reviewers, collecting reviews, taking editorial decisions based on reviews). The decision to ‘Revise’, ‘Recommend’ or ‘Reject’ the preprint is based on the recommender’s evaluation. A preprint recommended by {{appName}} is an article that may be used and cited like the ‘classic’ articles published in peer-reviewed journals. The normal outcome is, therefore, to leave the preprints on preprint servers or open repositories. However, the authors of a PCI-recommended article may prefer:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To publish their article in the Peer Community journal as is, immediately and at no cost</li>\r\n<li>To submit it to a PCI-friendly journal (acceptance with no further peer review OR response within 5 days OR use of the PCI evaluation if appropriate).</li>\r\n<li>To submit it to another journal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Details about the recommendation process can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://peercommunityin.org/2020/10/28/pci-recommender-guide/">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>By agreeing to become the recommender for this preprint, you agree to do your best to handle the peer-review process in as short a period as possible for the authors. Indeed, this rapid turnaround time is a key factor for the success of PCI as a credible alternative to journals.</p>\r\n<p>To this end, we need you:</p>\r\n<p>1-&nbsp;<strong>To send invitations to 5-10 potential reviewers as soon as possible (e.g. within the next 24 hours)</strong><strong> </strong>and then to send out new invitations until you find at least two reviewers willing to review the preprint. Sending multiple invitations increases the chances of finding available reviewers and keeping the turnaround time short. You may, of course, use whichever strategy you prefer to invite reviewers. The key thing is to avoid situations in which only a couple of invitations are sent out in 20 days, with only one reply after 30 days.<br>2-&nbsp;<strong>To post your decision,</strong>&nbsp;ideally <strong>within 10 days</strong>&nbsp;of receiving the reviews. <br>3-&nbsp;<strong>To write a recommendation text </strong><strong>(i.e. a text of 300 to 1,500 words describing the context and explaining why</strong> the preprint is particularly interesting)&nbsp;if you decide to recommend this preprint for {{appName}} at the end of the evaluation process, and to submit it as soon as possible after deciding to recommend the article.<br>4-&nbsp;<strong>To declare that you have no conflict of interest with the authors or the content of the article.</strong>&nbsp; See the <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/">code of conduct</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Details about the recommendation process can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://peercommunityin.org/2020/10/28/pci-recommender-guide/">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your help.</p>\r\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\r\n<p>The Managing Board of {{appName}}</p>
