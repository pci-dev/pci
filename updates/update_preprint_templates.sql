SET  contents = E'<p>Dear {{destPerson}},</p>\n<p>Thank you for submitting your work to PCI RR for consideration as a Registered Report (Stage 1). We are pleased to award in-principle acceptance (IPA) of your paper. Please read the following letter carefully.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please ensure that your Stage 2 manuscript, when submitted, states the URL to this Stage 1 manscript in the main text (see author guidelines for further details). Depending on the selections you made in the Stage 1 submission checklist, your approved Stage 1 protocol has been registered either publicly or under a private embargo. If you opted for a private embargo, note that the embargo will be released and the registered protocol made public when any one of the following conditions are met: submission of the Stage 2 manuscript; withdrawal of the submission and consequent triggering of a Withdrawn Registration; or natural expiry of the embargo at the end of the period you selected in the Stage 1 submission checklist.</p>\n<p>You may now progress to Stage 2 and complete the study as approved. We would be grateful if you could now update the journal office as to the anticipated completion date of your study. This deadline can be readily altered in consultation with the editors (e.g. in case of delays requiring additional time to complete the research). However, in the event that you should fail to submit the Stage 2 manuscript within 6 months of the mutually agreed deadline and also become non-responsive during this period to editorial enquiries, then the manuscript will be considered by the journal to be de facto withdrawn, triggering publication of a Withdrawn Registration. For technical reasons, your manuscript may appear on the system as rejected. Please disregard any such information. Following completion of your study, we invite you to resubmit your paper for peer review as a Stage 2 Registered Report.</p>\n<p>Please note that your manuscript can still be rejected for publication at Stage 2 if the editors consider any of the following conditions to be met:</p>\n<p>* The results were unable to test the \authors\' proposed hypotheses by failing to meet the approved outcome-neutral criteria<br>* The authors altered the Introduction, rationale, or hypotheses, as approved in the Stage 1 submission<br>* The authors failed to adhere to the registered study procedures or pre-registered analyses (and see below)<br>* Any post hoc (unregistered) analyses were either unjustified, insufficiently caveated, or overly dominant in shaping the \authors\' conclusions<br>* The \authors\' conclusions were not justified given the data obtained</p>\n<p>Please note that any deviation from the registered study procedures that is not approved in advance by the editors could lead to rejection of your manuscript at Stage 2.</p>\n<p>Please note that in cases where the pre-registered protocol must be altered after IPA due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g. change of equipment or unanticipated technical error), you must consult the editorial board immediately for advice, and PRIOR to the completion of data collection.<br>Minor changes to the protocol may be permitted according to editorial discretion.
