150	#WelcomingMessage	default	This search engine is devoted to look for manuscripts that have been recommended by Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology. Reviews, text of recommendations and manuscript information can be found here.\r\n\r\nOn this page, you may also request a recommendation for a preprint manuscript you authored (not reviewed yet and deposited in an open archive).  \r\n\r\nMembers of Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology can also start a recommendation process.

155	#UserSearchRecommenders	default	You can suggest members of PCI Evol Biol for considering your recommendation request. A member willing to consider your request becomes the “recommender” of this preprint. The recommender will send your request and your preprint for review. The “recommender” sends the reviews (which may or may not be written anonymously, at the reviewer’s discretion) to the authors and asks for modifications, if required. He/she eventually writes a short text of recommendation (together with the other reviewers, if they are willing to do so) explaining the recommendation, when all the requested modifications have been made.
156	#RecommenderDirectSubmission	default	In this page, you may start a new recommendation process for Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology (PCI Evol Biol) for a postprint article (already published or in press, already reviewed) that draw your attention. Fill in the form with the details of the manuscript to initiate the recommendation process. You will have to find a co-recommender, i.e. a colleague (who may be a member of PCI Evol Biol or not. In such case, your colleague will first have to register as a new member of PCI Evol Biol) who will write with you the recommendation text and sign it. Before starting the recommendation process for the manuscript of your choice, you have to be sure that this is in line with the code of ethical conduct of PCI Evol Biol (that can be found here)
161	#UserAddSuggestedRecommender	default	You can suggest members of PCI Evol Biol for considering your recommendation request. A member willing to consider your request becomes the “recommender” of your preprint and will evaluate it for a possible recommendation.

302	#RecommenderArticleReviews	default	\N
301	#RecommenderHelpInfo	default	####**As a member of *PCI Evol Biol*, you can recommend preprints**, i.e. articles not yet peer-reviewed and not yet published in scientific journals.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img alt="Preprints" src="../static/images/workflow3.png" width="900" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n###Before recommending a preprint \r\n\r\n1. You **must be sure that the preprint you have selected is remarkable**. Start a recommendation process only if you are highly motivated to do so and if the preprint has strong qualities: crucial, original or previously untested hypotheses, scientific rigor, refinement of the demonstration, outstanding quality of the data and methodology, noteworthy scientific consequences, etc.\r\n2. You **must be sure that you have no conflict of interest** of any kind with the content or with the authors of the preprint, and that you are not recommending a preprint from close colleagues, recent co-authors, relatives or friends.\r\n3. You must agree to comply with the [ethical code of conduct of PCI Evol Biol](http://147.99.65.220:82/PCiEvolBiol/about/ethics).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n     You can then start the recommendation process for this preprint by clicking on the green button at the end of this page. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n###Details about the recommendation process\r\n\r\n1. You read the preprint and you find it particularly interesting. You decide to initiate the recommendation process and become the “recommender” of the preprint.\r\n\r\n2. You must obtain (through the website) at least two high-quality reviews. You can be one of the reviewers so you have to find at least one additional reviewer within or outside PCI Evol Biol, selected on the basis of his/her expertise. You must continue to solicit reviews until you obtain at least two high-quality reviews, which may or may not include your own. Reviewers can choose to disclose their identity (preferred) or to remain anonymous.\r\n\r\n3. Once you have obtained the necessary reviews, you can write and send your decision to the authors of the preprint, together with the reviews, via the website. You may 1) accept the preprint recommendation request and write your recommendation, 2) ask the authors for modifications or 3) reject the request. If the authors modify their preprint, they must deposit a new version of the preprint in the preprint server and obtain a DOI for this new version. You then write a short text of recommendation explaining the recommendation, when all the requested modifications have been made\r\n\r\n4. The recommendation text signed by you, all reviews (anonymous or otherwise), and all correspondence with the authors are sent to the Managing Board of PCI Evol Biol. Before sending their recommendations and reviews, all recommenders and reviewers must declare that they have no conflict of interest of any kind with the content or the authors of the preprint, and that they are not recommending or reviewing an article published by close colleagues, recent co-authors, relatives or friends. The Managing Board will carry out a quality control check on the format and the deontology of reviews and recommendations.\r\n\r\n5. The recommendation text signed by you, all reviews (anonymous or otherwise), and all correspondence with the authors are posted on the PCI Evol Biol website. The recommendation is widely publicized in media and social networks, and becomes a citable reference.

347	#RecommenderEditDecisionText	default	For a first round of review, you must obtain at least two reviews of high quality. \r\n\r\n* __Recommend the preprint__ only if the preprint can now serve as reference in the scientific literature.  \r\n* __Ask for a revision__ if you think the process can eventually lead to a recommendation but the preprint needs improvements to attain this point.   \r\n* __Reject this preprint__ if you think that no amelioration can lead to a recommendation.   \r\n \r\n__In case you recommend the preprint__: \r\nYou have to write a so-called **Recommendation text** that will have a DOI and will be published. It should have a nice title, contain between about 300 to 1500 words, describe the context and explain why the preprint is worth a recommendation. Limits of the preprint can also be discussed. This text also contains references (at least that of the preprint).

reviewing and recommending preprints (unpublished articles) and, to a lesser extent, recommending postprints (published articles) in their field. These specific communities are entitled Peer Community in X, e.g. %(description)s.  \r\nThe goal of the PCIs is to highlight and recommend preprints as of particular interest to the community concerned. The preprints recommended by PCIs are complete articles of high value that do not necessarily need to be published in traditional journals.  \r\n \r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="What is the goal of the various PCIs?">What is the goal of the various PCIs?</div>\r\nThe aim of PCI is to offer scientists a free, stimulating, transparent and non-exclusive way to validate and promote their scientific output, by removing this monopoly from journals.  \r\nPCIs publicly highlight and recommend high-quality preprints. The preprints recommended by PCIs are complete articles of high value, that are reliable and citable without the need for publication in traditional journals.  \r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="What is the role of the recommender?">What is the role of the recommender?</div>\r\nRecommenders evaluate, and may choose to recommend preprints that have not been published by or submitted to a journal. To a lesser extent, they may also recommend postprints, i.e. articles already published in journals. Preprint evaluation is a role similar to that of a journal editor (finding reviewers, collecting reviews, making editorial decisions based on reviews), with the possibility of recommending the preprint after several rounds of review. When recommenders decide to recommend a preprint, they write a “recommendation”, which has its own DOI and is published in the electronic journal of the PCI in X. The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News & Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context and explains why the preprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of the preprint may also be discussed. This text also contains references (citing at least the recommended preprint). The recommendation of a postprint is more straightforward: the recommender selects a postprint that he/she wishes to recommend and invites a second recommender from PCI in X to write a joint recommendation text.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="What is a recommendation?">What is a recommendation?</div>\r\nA “recommendation” is a short article written by one or several recommenders, describing why an article (preprint or postprint) is particularly interesting.

The website is freely accessible.  \r\n\r\n**Transparent:** Reviews and recommendations (for preprints) and recommendations (for postprints) are freely available for consultation. Recommendations are signed by the recommenders. Reviewers may choose to remain anonymous or to sign their reviews.  \r\n\r\n**Flexible and simple:** The Managing Board does not intervene in the process (i.e. it does not act as an editorial committee), other than to resolve problems between authors and the recommenders evaluating their articles. It also performs quality control checks, assessing the format and deontology of reviews and recommendations.   \r\n\r\n**Not exclusive:** A preprint may be recommended by different Peer Communities in X (a feature of particular interest for articles relating to multidisciplinary studies) and may even subsequently be published in a traditional journal (although this is not the goal of the PCIs).  \r\n\r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="What place will the PCI project occupy in the scientific landscape?">What place will the PCI project occupy in the scientific landscape?</div>\r\n\r\nSeveral Peer Communities in X will exist in various scientific fields (e.g. phytopathology, ecology, cancer research, etc.). The goal is not to set up a monopoly, and several alternative recommending systems may coexist with the PCI project. Preprints recommended by PCIs would not necessarily require subsequent publication in classic journals, because they are high-quality complete articles that are reliable and citable in their own right. In time, we expect PCIs to become the major medium for the publication of scientific output.  \r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="How does the “Peer Community in” project differ from closely related initiatives?">How does the “Peer Community in” project differ from closely related initiatives?</div> \r\n\r\n**F1000Prime:** Readers have to pay to read F1000 recommendations. F1000Prime is a for-profit business and is not intended to replace the current system based on journal publications. F1000Prime recommendations concern only published articles. F1000Prime does not, to our knowledge, wish to recommend preprints.  \r\n\r\n**Winnover** is “an open access online scholarly publishing platform that employs open post-publication peer review”.

Winnover allows authors 1) to upload an article onto their platform and then encourages researchers, colleagues, and other scientists to make critical comments on the article over a given period of time and 2) to revise the article on the basis of the comments received and to provide the new version with a DOI. It is therefore not a “recommendation” as such, but an open process of critical review without a given threshold determining whether an article may be considered scientifically “valid”.  \r\n\r\n**The Peerage of Science** initiative operates upstream from the publication system and provides support to existing scientific journals. It is not, therefore, intended to replace the current system. The goal is to submit an article actively to obtain constructive criticism before submitting it (and the responses to the criticisms received) to a scientific journal. It is stated that “Authors may accept a live publishing offer from a subscription-only journal, or may choose to export the peer reviews to any journal of their choice.” and that “The revenues of Peerage of Science come from organizations wishing to purchase the peer review services for use in their decision-making, such as publishers, funding organization, and universities.” Again, this is a very different model from the PCI project.  \r\n\r\n**Episcience** has the objective of favoring the emergence of “epijournals”, electronic open-access journals containing items deposited in open archives, such as arXiv, and not published elsewhere. Our project is not intended to create a journal. It is, instead, a system for recognizing remarkable articles by awarding them a recommendation, and this recommending process is possible for both articles that have already been published and for articles deposited in open archives.  \r\n\r\n**eLife** is a journal publishing original articles with publication fees. "On January 1, 2017, eLife will introduce a fee for publication. A fee of $2,500 will be collected for all published papers submitted on or after this date"(https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elifeauthorinstructions.html#fees).  \r\n\r\n**PeerJ:** Authors have to pay to publish in PeerJ. Either they pay $1,095 to publish a paper or each author pays a one-off fee of $399 (or more) allowing them to publish 1 (or more) paper/year in the journal (https://peerj.com/pricing/#apc-membership-pricing).  \r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="How can I start a new Peer Community in X?">How can I start a new Peer Community in X?</div>\r\n\r\nThe non-profit PCI organization is responsible for the creation and functioning of the various specific Peer Communities in X. The members of the Managing Boards of each Peer Community in X will also be members of the non-profit “Peer Community in” organization. Hence, representatives of all existing Peer Communities in X would collectively take decisions concerning the creation of each new Peer Community in X. If you would like to launch a new Peer Community in X, you should contact a Managing Board member and explain your project.  \r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="Could articles be recommended by several different Peer Communities in X?">Could articles be recommended by several different Peer Communities in X?</div>\r\n\r\nYes, and this is one of the chief advantages of PCI. The recommendation process is not exclusive and articles of interest to several different Peer Communities in X could be recommended by all those communities. This aspect is of particular interest for articles dealing with multidisciplinary studies. There would be no a priori hierarchy of communities, although some would be highly generalist (e.g. PCI Mathematics) whereas others would be more specialized (e.g. PCI Entomology). However, to avoid recommendations of various versions of an article, a preprint already recommended by a Peer Community in X could only be recommended by another Peer Community in X as it stands. In other words, once a Peer Community in X has recommended a preprint, this latter must be considered reviewed (i.e. like a published article) by all the other Peer Communities in X interested by recommending it.  \r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="Who came up with this project?">Who came up with this project?</div>\r\n\r\nThe PCI project is an original idea of Denis Bourguet, Benoit Facon and Thomas Guillemaud, working at INRA (the French National Institute for Agricultural Research) in France.  \r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************\r\n##<font color="#598398">FUNCTIONING OF %(longname)s</font>\r\n\r\n##<div id="What do I have to do as a recommender for %(longname)s?">What do I have to do as a recommender for %(longname)s?</div>\r\nEach recommender is expected to manage the evaluation process for one or two articles per year, on average. Thus, becoming a recommender for %(longname)s is not associated with a substantial workload. Recommenders evaluate and may recommend preprints that have not been published by or submitted to a journal. To a lesser extent, they can also recommend postprints (i.e. articles published in journals). Evaluating a preprint means playing a role similar to that of a journal editor (finding reviewers, collecting reviews, making editorial decisions based on reviews) and, possibly, recommending the preprint after several rounds of review. Recommenders deciding to recommend a particular preprint write a “recommendation” for that preprint, which has its own DOI and is published in the electronic journal of the PCI in X. The recommendation is a short article, similar to a News & Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context and explains why the preprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of the preprint can also be discussed. This text also contains references (referring at least to the preprint recommended). Recommending a postprint is more straightforward: the recommender chooses a postprint that he/she wishes to recommend and invites a second recommender from PCI in X to write a joint recommendation text.  \r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="How can I become a recommender for %(longname)s?">How can I become a recommender for %(longname)s?</div>\r\nNew recommenders are nominated by [current recommenders](../public/recommenders) and approved by the Managing Board.

If a %(longname)s recommender is interested by the preprint, he/she initiates the evaluation process. This process is very similar to the process of evaluation for publication in a journal, and includes at least two high-quality peer reviews. Based on these reviews, the recommender decides to reject or to recommend the preprint as it stands, or asks the authors to revise their preprint. Several rounds of reviews may be required before a recommender decides to reject or recommend a preprint. When the recommender is satisfied by the reply and changes made by the authors, he/she can decide to recommend the preprint. This requires the recommender to write a “recommendation”, a short article, similar to a News & Views piece. This recommendation has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context, contains references (a reference to the preprint recommended at the very least) and explains why the preprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of the preprint may also be discussed. Once validated by the Managing Board, the “recommendation” and all the editorial correspondence (reviews, your decisions, authors’ replies) are then published by %(longname)s.\r\n&nbsp;  \r\n*For postprints* (i.e. articles already reviewed and published in scientific journals): Two recommenders of %(longname)s consider a postprint as particularly interesting and worth recommending to %(longname)s. They cowrite a “recommendation”, which is a short article, similar to a News & Views piece. It has its own title, contains between about 300 and 1500 words, describes the context, provides a link to the DOI of the article, contains references (a reference to the preprint recommended, at least) and explains why the postprint is particularly interesting. The limitations of the postprint may also be discussed. Once validated by the Managing Board, this “recommendation”, is published by %(longname)s. \r\n&nbsp;  \r\nThe recommendation text, signed by two recommenders, provides a link to the DOI of the article and is published.  \r\n\r\n<a href="#haut">↑</a>\r\n\r\n##<div id="How can I submit my preprint to %(longname)s?">How can I submit my preprint to %(longname)s?</div>\r\nYou must first deposit your preprint in an open archive.

I’m handling a paper preprint by XXX and entitled XXX (doi XXX).  \r\n\r\nI’m wondering if you would be willing to provide a review – possibly within 20 days – of the manuscript. If you are willing, please create an account on the website of PCI Evol Biol (https://evolbiol.peercommunityin.org/). I can then send you a request for review through the website that will have to accept.  \r\n\r\nYou may not yet know about PCI Evol Biol. Briefly, it is a community of researchers in Evolutionary Biology dedicated to reviewing and (if they are high quality) recommending articles publicly available in preprint servers (such as bioRxiv). Our motivation is to establishment a high-profile, free, public evaluation system for identifying high-quality articles. More information can be found on the web site, complete with a short video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMhVl__gupg). Review itself works largely like it does for a journal (including the ability to remain anonymous or not, as you like).  \r\n\r\nLet me know if you think you can do the above review.  \r\nThanks in advance  \r\nBest wishes  \r\nXXX  \r\n\r\n..................................
