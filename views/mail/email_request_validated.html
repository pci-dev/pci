Dear {{=person}},
<p>
You have requested a recommendation to <i>{{=appdesc}}</i> (<i>{{=applongname}}</i>) for your manuscript entitled <b>{{=article.title}}</b> on behalf of all authors. 
We thank you for that.
<p>
We remind you that this request is not a submission, as <i>{{=applongname}}</i> has no obligation to consider your manuscript. 
We will try our best but we cannot guaranty that your manuscript will be reviewed.
<p>
We also remind you that, by soliciting <i>{{=applongname}}</i>, you agree to wait at least 20 days before submitting this manuscript to a journal or request a recommendation to another Peer Community in.<br>
This delay will allow <i>{{=applongname}}</i> to initiate a recommendation process and if so to avoid a simultaneous review process â€“ i.e. one performed by <i>{{=applongname}}</i> and one undertaken by a traditional scientific journal or another <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/">Peer Community In</a>.
<p>
You will be notified by e-mail if a member of the <i>{{=applongname}}</i> chooses/decides to start a peer-review process of your manuscript. 
You will then be asked if you agree to engage in the peer review process, and in case of a positive answer your manuscript will be sent to at least 2 reviewers. 
You may then be asked to modify you manuscript and to reply to the questions and points raised by the reviewers.
<p>
In case of a favorable conclusion of the member of <i>{{=applongname}}</i> in charge of your MS, a recommendation will be published on the web site of <i>{{=applongname}}</i> and widely publicized trough social and scientific networks.<br>
Alternatively, a second round of reviews may be needed or a decision to not recommend your manuscript may be made. 
You will be notified by e-mail at each step of the procedure.

We thank you again for your recommendation request.

Sincerely yours,
