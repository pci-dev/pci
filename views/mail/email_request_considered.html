Dear {{=person}},
<p>
You have requested a recommendation to <i>{{=appdesc}}</i> (<i>{{=applongname}}</i>) for your manuscript entitled <b>{{=article.title}}</b> on behalf of all authors. 
We have the pleasure to inform you that a member of <i>{{=applongname}}</i> has read your manuscript and is about to send it in review. 
<p>
We remind you that this request is not a submission, as <i>{{=applongname}}</i> has no obligation to consider your manuscript. 
We will try our best but we cannot guaranty that your manuscript will be reviewed.
<p>
At this step of the process we have to verify that you are still willing to engage your manuscript in the peer-review process.
<p>
In case of a positive answer, you will have to wait the completion of the reviewing process (or no more than 50 days) before you submit this manuscript to a journal or request a recommendation to another <i>Peer Community in</i>. 
<p>
Your manuscript will be sent to several referees in order to obtain at least two reviews of high quality. 
You may then be asked to modify you manuscript and to reply to the questions and points raised by the reviewers. 
In case of a favorable conclusion of the member of <i>{{=applongname}}</i> in charge of your MS, a recommendation will be published on the web site of <i>{{=applongname}}</i>. 
Alternatively, a second round of reviews may be needed or a decision to not recommend your manuscript may be made. 
You will be notified by e-mail at each step of the procedure.
<p>
Having read this information, are you still willing to engage your manuscript entitled <b>{{=article.title}}</b> in the peer-review process?
