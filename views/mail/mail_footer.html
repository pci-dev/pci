    <i>%(appName)s</i> is one of the communities of the parent project Peer
    Community In. It is a community of researchers in %(appThematics)s dedicated
    to the recommendation of preprints publicly available from open archives (such
    as bioRxiv, arXiv, PaleorXiv, etc.), based on a high-quality peer-review
    process. This project was driven by a desire to establish a free, transparent
    and public scientific publication system based on the review and
    recommendation of preprints. More information can be found on the website of
